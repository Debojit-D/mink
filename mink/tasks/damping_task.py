class DampingTask(PostureTask):
    r"""L2-regularization on joint velocities (a.k.a. *velocity damping*).

    This low-priority task adds a Tikhonov/Levenberg-Marquardt term to the
    quadratic program, making the Hessian strictly positive-definite and
    selecting the **minimum-norm joint velocity** in any redundant or
    near-singular situation. Formally it contributes

    .. math::
        \tfrac12 \sum_{i=1}^{n_v} \lambda_i \dot q_i^{\,2},

    where ``cost`` provides the weights :math:`\lambda_i`. Setting a larger
    weight *reduces* motion in that DoF; with no other active tasks the robot
    simply remains at rest.

    This task does not favor a particular postureâ€”only small instantaneous
    motion. If you need a posture bias, use an explicit :class:`~.PostureTask`.

    .. note::

        Floating-base coordinates are not affected by this task.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Uniform damping across all degrees of freedom.
        damping_task = DampingTask(model, cost=1.0)

        # Custom damping.
        cost = np.zeros(model.nv)
        cost[:3] = 1.0  # High damping for the first 3 joints.
        cost[3:] = 0.1  # Lower damping for the remaining joints.
        damping_task = DampingTask(model, cost)
